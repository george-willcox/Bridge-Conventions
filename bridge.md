## Rules

- High Card Points (HCP) are the main method of determining the value of a hand

  |---|---|
  |A|4|
  |K|3|
  |Q|2|
  |J|1|

### Rule of 12

- A common rule for determining whether to open with a hand is to count the HCPs and open if you have 12 or more.

### Rule of 20

- An alternative, which also takes into account the shape of a hand, is the Rule of 20.
- The Rule of 20 is a calculation to see if your hand has opening strength.
